[h1]Host a multiplayer game and let your friends to view and subscribe your addons! Players that are joining your game will automatically download required addons so they won't see errors on custom models.[/h1]
[i]Also tested on dedicated server.[/i]

[h1]More detailed description:[/h1]
'Addon Share' provides a list of your installed addons to players via [b][i]Utilities / Addon Share / Addons[/i][/b] menu. Your friends and guests may subscribe to addons you have in couple clicks.
Moreover, it adds "required addons", which will be downloaded before player connects to server. (this feature may be toggled with [i]addonshare_dependencies[/i] console variable)

[b]This addon will be useful, if people complain about errors instead of weapons / ragdolls / cars / whatever you've downloaded from workshop.[/b]

[h1]What will be added to "required addons":[/h1]
• Current gamemode and map (this is default GMod's behaviour)
• Enabled addons, if they contain models

[h1]What will not be added to "required addons":[/h1]
• Other hoster's maps
• Legacy (filesystem) addons
• Tools, scripts, other stuff based on ingame content (because they are serverside and will work anyway)
• Content from other games (CS:Source, TF2, EP2, etc.)

[h1]Known issues:[/h1]
• Category icons in list are not displayed for 'Addon Share' installed on dedicated server

[h1]Comparing to other addons:[/h1]
• [b]WSDL[/b] checks addon content, and adds ones that contain next filetypes: [i]mdl, vtx, wav, mp3, vmt, vtf, png[/i]. Addon Share depends on addon's metadata i.e. tags, models count. If you want to use these addons alongside, consider setting [i]addonshare_dependencies 0[/i] in console.
